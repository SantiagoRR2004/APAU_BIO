# Bio-inspired Machine Learning

## Overview

These are all the codes for a subject called "Aprendizaje Autom√°tico Bio-inspirado" (Bio-inspired Machine Learning). Even though the subject were called that, it also included content on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

Sessions [02](/session02/), [03](/session03/) and [04](/session04/) were dedicated to Bio-inspired Machine Learning; sessions [05](/session05/), [06](/session06/) and [07](/session07/) were focused on Reinforcement Learning, and sessions [08](/session08/), [09](/session09/), [10](/session10/) and [11](/session11/) were centered on Deep Learning.

Twenty percent of the final grade was based on presenting this code in the lab sessions. Since we didn't have any mistakes, we received full marks. The code could be developed by pairs, so we formed a team of two.
